# cerconn: cerebellar functional connectivity maps

Seed regions are the Buckner 7 set as produced by cersuit pipeline. Four sets are computed: with 
and without removal of the mean gray matter signal by regression; with and without erosion of the
seed ROIs with a 1-voxel radius spherical kernel. Both bivariate Pearson correlation and partial
correlation with respect to the other seed regions are computed.
